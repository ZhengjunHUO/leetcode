You have k lists of sorted integers in non-decreasing order. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists.

We define the range [a, b] is smaller than range [c, d] if b - a < d - c or a < c if b - a == d - c.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [[4,10,15,24,26],[0,9,12,20],[5,18,22,30]]
Output: [20,24]
Explanation: 
List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]
Output: [1,1]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [[10,10],[11,11]]
Output: [10,11]
Example 4:

Input: nums = [[10],[11]]
Output: [10,11]
Example 5:

Input: nums = [[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7]]
Output: [1,7]
 

Constraints:

nums.length == k
1 <= k <= 3500
1 <= nums[i].length <= 50
-105 <= nums[i][j] <= 10^5
nums[i] is sorted in non-decreasing order.
