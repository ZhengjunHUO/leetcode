Your task is to calculate ab mod 1337 where a is a positive integer and b is an extremely large positive integer given in the form of an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: a = 2, b = [3]
Output: 8
Example 2:

Input: a = 2, b = [1,0]
Output: 1024
Example 3:

Input: a = 1, b = [4,3,3,8,5,2]
Output: 1
Example 4:

Input: a = 2147483647, b = [2,0,0]
Output: 1198
 

Constraints:

1 <= a <= 2^31 - 1
1 <= b.length <= 2000
0 <= b[i] <= 9
b doesn't contain leading zeros.
