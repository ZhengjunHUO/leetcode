Given an array of integers ribbons And an integer k. For each rope , You can cut anything into a series of parts with a positive integer length , Or choose not to cut .

for example , If you are given a length of 4 The rope of , You can ï¼š

Keep the length of the rope 4 unchanged ;
Cut into a length of 3 And a length of 1 The rope of ;
Cut into two strips with a length of 2 The rope of ;
Cut into a length of 2 And two strips of length 1 The rope of ;
Cut into four strips with a length of 1 The rope of .
Your task is to finally get k strip Completely equally The rope of , Their length is the same positive integer .
If there is any residue after the rope is cut , You can just throw away the excess .

For this k A rope , Return to the rope you can get Maximum length ;
If you can't get k A rope of the same length , return 0.

 Example  1:
 Input : ribbons = [9,7,5], k = 3
 Output : 5
 explain :
-  Cut the first rope in two , A length of  5, A length of  4;
-  Cut the second rope in two , A length of  5, A length of  2;
-  The third rope is not cut ;
 Now? , You got it.  3  The length of the bar is  5  The rope of .

 Example  2:
 Input : ribbons = [7,5,9], k = 4
 Output : 4
 explain :
-  Cut the first rope in two , A length of  4, A length of  3;
-  Cut the second rope in two , A length of  4, A length of  1;
-  Cut the second rope into three parts , A length of  4, A length of  4, There is also a length of  1;
 Now? , You got it.  4  The length of the bar is  4  The rope of .

 Example  3:
 Input : ribbons = [5,7,9], k = 22
 Output : 0
 explain :  Since the rope length needs to be a positive integer , You can't get  22  A rope of the same length .
 
 Tips :
1 <= ribbons.length <= 10^5
1 <= ribbons[i] <= 10^5
1 <= k <= 10^9
