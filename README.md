# LeetCode in Go

## LeetCode Algorithm/Solution in Golang

1. One folder One problem. Each folder contains a txt file which describe the problem. 
- The solution easy to figure out (for me) is in naive*.go, the name may contain some info about method used. For the rest *.go (eg. solution.go) is the solution i learned after research (especially thank to all who contributed to the “Discuss” section for those brillant ideas !). 
- For each problem, the final solution should reach the best possible time & space complexity, before move on to the next problem. 
- Commented in Chinese (we can explain the same idea with less words).
	
2. About Go, normally I only import fmt to print out the result to check quickly if the algorithm works as expected. For some problems which engage data types, i use my [homemade thread-safe go data type](https://github.com/ZhengjunHUO/godtype)

3. I didn’t specifically note down the difficulty of the problems, because it’s quite subjective and depends on your experience on some type of problem: you can easily solve some “hard” problems if you’ve figured out some sort of “template”  of this type in 10 minutes, but cat get stuck for hours by some “easy” problems you are not quite familiar or you've never seen before (like 初見殺し boss in game :) ?)
